# Project Base for Vaadin and Spring Boot - added with calendar widget

The original project was taken from the quick start section of vaadin flow. 

I added a few things to test dark mode with the calendar widget (https://github.com/FlowingCode/YearMonthCalendarAddon)


## Running the Application
The project is a standard Maven project. To run it from the command line, type `mvn` and open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

You can also import the project to your IDE of choice as you would with any
Maven project. Read more on [how to set up a development environment for
Vaadin projects](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/guide/install) (Windows, Linux, macOS).
